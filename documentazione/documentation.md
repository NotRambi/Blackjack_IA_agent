# Documentation for the Blackjack Simulation Project

## Simulation.py

This script is responsible for running multiple simulations of the Blackjack game using multi-threading. It allows for the configuration of various parameters such as the number of AI agents, naive agents, decks, starting money, hands per simulation, and the number of simulations. The results of each simulation are collected and statistical analysis is performed.

### Functions

- `run_game_with_queue(game, queue)`: Runs a game instance and puts the result in a queue.

### Main Execution

- Parses command-line arguments to set simulation parameters.
- Initializes threads for each simulation.
- Starts and joins threads to run simulations concurrently.
- Collects results from the queue and calculates average results for each agent type.
- Prints the simulation results and statistics.

## Blackjack.py

This file contains the classes for managing the Blackjack game, including players, AI agents, naive agents, and the dealer. Each class has methods for handling game actions such as betting, drawing cards, calculating hand values, and making decisions based on game state.

### Classes

        - `ChooseCarta(MyHand, DealerHand)`: Decides whether to draw a card or pass.
        - `chooseBet()`: Decides the bet amount based on the game state.

- `AgenteNaive`: Represents a naive agent, inherits from `Giocatore`.
    - Methods: 
        - `HandValueCalc(hand)`: Calculates the value of a hand.
        - `ChooseCarta(MyHand, DealerHand)`: Decides whether to draw a card or pass arbitrarily.
        - `chooseBet()`: Decides the bet amount (fixed at 1% of the initial money).
        - `addCardToDealer(carta)`: Updates the dealer's hand (not used in naive agent).
        - `updateMazzo(uscite)`: Updates the deck (not used in naive agent).
        - `resetMazzo()`: Resets the deck (not used in naive agent).

- `dealer`: Represents the dealer in the game.
    - Methods: 
        - `ValoreCarta(carta)`: Calculates the value of a card.
        - `addCard(carta)`: Adds a card to the dealer's hand and updates the hand value.
        - `toStrMano()`: Returns a string representation of the dealer's hand.
        - `resetMano()`: Resets the dealer's hand at the end of a round.

## GUI.py

This file manages the graphical user interface (GUI) for the Blackjack game using the Tkinter library. It allows users to start a game, adjust settings, and view game statistics.

### Classes

    - Methods: 
        - `__init__()`: Initializes the GUI and its components.
        - `on_closing()`: Handles the closing event of the GUI.
        - `update()`: Updates the GUI.
        - `run()`: Runs the main loop of the GUI.

        - `PlayButton()`: Handles the play button click event.
        - `SettingsButton()`: Handles the settings button click event.
        - `clearHome()`: Clears the home page components.
        - `GamePage()`: Displays the game page.
        - `startGame()`: Starts a new game.
        - `stopGame()`: Stops the current game.
        - `Game_backToHP()`: Returns to the home page from the game page.

        - `SettingsPage()`: Displays the settings page.
        - `updateSlider(event)`: Updates the slider values for players and AI agents.
        - `statisticsBtn()`: Toggles the statistics option.
        - `VideoBtn()`: Toggles the video option.
        - `Setting_backToHP()`: Returns to the home page from the settings page.
        - `clearSettings()`: Clears the settings page components.
